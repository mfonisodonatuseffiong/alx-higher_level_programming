Exploring Object Instantiation in Python

This project focuses on the process of object instantiation within Python. Object instantiation, essentially, involves the creation of a new instance derived from a class. Put simply, it's the act of generating an object according to the specifications outlined in a class blueprint.

To initiate the creation of an object, the initial step entails defining a class. A class serves as a blueprint, delineating the characteristics and functionalities of objects instantiated from it. Following class definition, objects can be instantiated by invoking the class name followed by parentheses.

Object instantiation constitutes a foundational principle in object-oriented programming (OOP), enabling the creation of diverse instances of a class, each potentially possessing distinct attribute values.

The project comprised a series of quiz-style inquiries, with corresponding answers stored in individual single-line .txt files.
